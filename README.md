## 💡 Tips, Hacks & Tricks

### **VSCode Hacks**
- **Zen Mode:** Press `Ctrl + K Z` to enter Zen Mode, hiding all distractions.
- **Multi-Cursor Magic:** Hold `Alt` and click to create multiple cursors for faster editing.
- **Quick Rename:** Highlight a variable and press `F2` to rename it everywhere in your code.

### **Git & GitHub Hacks**
- **Speedy Commits:** Use `git commit -am "message"` to add and commit in one step.
- **Undo Last Commit:** Made a mistake? Use `git reset --soft HEAD~1` to undo the last commit without losing your changes.
- **Keep Your Fork Up to Date:** Sync your forked repository with the original using `git pull upstream master`.

### **JavaScript Fun**
- **Array Sorting:** Use `arr.sort((a, b) => a - b)` to quickly sort an array of numbers.
- **Flatten an Array:** Use `arr.flat(Infinity)` to flatten an array of arrays into a single-level array.
- **Shuffling an Array:** Use `arr.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5)` for a quick shuffle.

### **Terminal Power**
- **History Search:** Press `Ctrl + R` to search through your terminal command history.
- **Create Aliases:** Save time with aliases like `alias gs='git status'` to shorten common commands.
- **Directory Navigation:** Jump back two directories with `cd ../..` or forward using `pushd`.

### **Fun CLI Commands**
- **Watch Star Wars:** Type `telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl` in the terminal and watch Star Wars in ASCII.
- **Cowsay:** Install `cowsay` and have a fun ASCII cow deliver your terminal messages with `cowsay "Hello, world!"`.
- **Fortune:** Combine `cowsay` with `fortune` for a cow that shares random fortunes: `fortune | cowsay`.
